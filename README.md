# MATSCI-176-Final-Project

In this project, we attempt to show the efficacy of using a synthetically generated dataset to train a multi-task Convolutional Neural Network to classify Hyperspectral Optical Microscope (HOM) data cubes between substrate vs material, as well as predicting the oxidation time of the sample using regression.
