The equations for the Lorentzian shaped DRS curves were generated by performing a non-linear least squares lorentzian fitting of the original dataset from a Hyperspectral Optical Microscope (HOM) in the range of 550 - 700 nm which is right around the A-exciton peak of WS2. This was done for each ground truth oxidation time step from 0 - 15 minutes. This code block also consists of simulated noise and slight variations in the peak parameters corresponding to the confidence of the original peak fit.\n","\n","##### The Convolutional Neural Network architecture that was used includes two branches, one for classification and one for regression. We also used a custom \"Masked MAE\" loss function to ensure that the regression loss is only calculated on pixels that were classified as material since we do not expect any change from the substrate signal with increased oxidation time."],"metadata":{"id":"zVv_sEX5mJbG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Training the Model"],"metadata":{"id":"C042qBTVmZKL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers, models\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import os"],"metadata":{"id":"zK_IcP2BzxnI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"u9WXB7hVloQa"},"outputs":[],"source":["n_wavelengths = 150\n","num_samples = 50000\n","wavelengths = np.linspace(550, 700, n_wavelengths)\n","\n","# Create oxidation times (70% of samples will be material)\n","material_samples = int(num_samples * 0.7)\n","oxidation_times = np.random.uniform(0, 15, material_samples)\n","\n","def lorentzian(wavelengths, amplitude, width, position):\n","    return amplitude * (width**2 / ((wavelengths -
